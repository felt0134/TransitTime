This R project contains the primary code and data used for data production,manipulation,
and analysis and figure production or the study entitled:

"Global estimates of the storage and transit time of water through vegetation"

Please not that the "supporting code" folder also contains the python scripts used
to generate aboveground water storage and transit time estimate for the study. 
The ultimate output from those scripts can be found in the "turnover_from_python"
folder, which contains annual, monthly, and seasonal estimates of aboveground storage
and transit time in both .nc and .csv file formats. The 2016 vegetation optical depth
data used for those analyses can be found in a Zenodo repostiry:

The monthly-scale canopy transpiration data used can be found here:

Please note, both the python and R scripts use relative filepaths to import data.

The climate data used can be found here:

XXX

Each R script in this project has a particular function:

01_start.R: This script loads the R packages used int he analysis, sets the
directory, and imports the user-created functions for the project in the 
02_functions.R script. This script can also download the annual and minumum 
transit datasets, which are core to the analyses.

03_generate_data.R This script is not necessary to run and is primarily
for documentation. The main role of this code was to import and wrangle
the data needed to calculate ground-based estimates of aboveground water storage.

04_annual_turnover_storage_import.R: This script imports the annual turnover and
storage data for each landcover type.

05_annual_turnover_storage_import.R: This script imports the minimum turnover and
storage data for each landcover type. Miniomum is defined as the lowest monthly
estimate.

06_figures_tables.R: This is the main workhouse. This script generates the key 
figures and summary statstics used in the study that the get saved in the 
manuscripts_figures folder. Maps were produced using Python.
